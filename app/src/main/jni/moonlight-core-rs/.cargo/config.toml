# Target for local development (host)
# For Android builds, use cargo-ndk which handles toolchain setup automatically

[env]
# Use Ninja as the CMake generator for faster builds
# This affects audiopus_sys which uses cmake to build libopus
CMAKE_GENERATOR = "Ninja"

# Fix CMake compatibility with older CMakeLists.txt (opus uses cmake_minimum_required < 3.5)
CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM = "3.5"

# These will be overridden by cargo-ndk
# ANDROID_NDK_HOME is required
